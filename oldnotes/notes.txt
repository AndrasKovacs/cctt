- stable val: stable under isub, stores an isub
- unstable val: can compute under isub, stores an isub + a cof s.t. the if it's true, the
  value may compute

- eval: goes from syntax to vals. Computes eagerly under interval binder, only stops when it hits
  a value binder. When evaluating an unstable term, we -âˆ¨- recursive unstable cof-s in the result.

- forcing: goes from vals to vals. Computes the head w.r.t. an isub.

  - forcing a stable val composes the stored isub with the new one
  - forcing an unstable val:
    - if cof holds under new isub, we force the value
    - otherwise we compose the stored isub and store the updated cof

Alternative:

  - We only mark in values whether something is stable or unstable, but not the cof.
    Forcing an unstable thing always walks the value. Simpler but maybe less efficient.
