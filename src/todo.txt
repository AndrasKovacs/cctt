IBind:
- new construction, stores ivar + value
- the value only depends on vars <= ivar (explicit weakening!)
- the ivar is the "abstracted" variable, others are "free" vars
- substitution:
  1. we trim down the subst to only the free vars of the IBind
  2. we map the abstracted var to the next fresh var in Dom
     - apply the subst to body value
     - the new abstracted var is the next fresh var
- forcing:
  1. we trim down the ncof to the IBind free vars
  2. we force the body

Substitutions:
- store dom + cod
- reduce range to 12 possible ivars
- the dom will be needed when substituting ibinders

NCofs:
- each ivar is mapped to the *least* representative ivar
