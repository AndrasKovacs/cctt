refactor printed name handling

ivar insertion? avoid symtable entry?


sugar:
  - omit binders from coe, hcom, depPath when arg is path or line!
  - distinguish the sugary versions already in presyntax

overload map functions?

- add builtins with bidir checking: refl, _⁻¹, _◼_, ap, com, etc..

- (Switch megaparsec to strict bytestring input)

- test stuff (cubicaltt prelude, examples)

- add parametrized strict inductives (then perhaps remove Nat)
- add weak HITs
- file imports

- glued eval
  - How: add glue values
  - forcing does not remove glue
  - all semantic functions preserve glue
  - how to repr glued vals?
    - we don't use spines
    - Just another kind of neutral: Glue Ne ~Val

- hole printing
