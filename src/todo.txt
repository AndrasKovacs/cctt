- fix yaccttprelude evaluation error
- fix shadowed name printing and handling
- fix "_" name printing
- add debug pretty printing mode which is usable during evaluation
  (prints vars as indices)
- sugar for iterated projection:
  (print right-nested projection as number?
    x.1  ~ x.1
    x.2  ~ x.2.1
    x.3  ~ x.2.2.1
    x.4  ~ x.2.2.2.1
    but what about the rightmost field? Should we just use a dummy ending field?
- improve system compat error messages
- add explicit Path applications
  Purpose: the normalization in PApp elaboration for the endpoints could
  blow up. Explicit endpoints can be used to avoid that.

OPT:
- hcom evaluation: fuse instantiation and evaluation:
  - if some branch is true, eval the term under the instantiation
    - downside: we have to duplicate some hcom code, or else store
      more info in VSystem
- coe Glue: look at the unfolded hcom fib defn
