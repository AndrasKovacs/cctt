- add explicit Path applications
  Purpose: the normalization in PApp elaboration for the endpoints could
  blow up. Explicit endpoints can be used to avoid that.
- handle printing and re-parsing of "_"-bound vars! We should test
  re-checking yaccttprelude definition nfs.


overload map functions in impl?

- add builtins with bidir checking: refl, _⁻¹, _◼_, ap, com, etc..

- (Switch megaparsec to strict bytestring input)

- test stuff (cubicaltt prelude, examples)

- add parametrized strict inductives (then perhaps remove Nat)
- add weak HITs
- file imports

- glued eval
  - How: add glue values
  - forcing does not remove glue
  - all semantic functions preserve glue
  - how to repr glued vals?
    - we don't use spines
    - Just another kind of neutral: Glue Ne ~Val

- hole printing
