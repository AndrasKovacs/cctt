Testing:
  - hcom and coe comp rules

Feature:
- all Kan computation rules
- strict inductives
- HITs

Convenience:
- sugar for cof disjunction and âˆ€ in systems.

- sugar for iterated projection:
  (print right-nested projection as number?
    x.1  ~ x.1
    x.2  ~ x.2.1
    x.3  ~ x.2.2.1
    x.4  ~ x.2.2.2.1
    but what about the rightmost field? Should we just use a dummy ending field?

- improve system compatibility error messages
  - improve system error positions


Performance:

- bring back hcom' optimization
- optimize com the same way as with hcom'
- unbox VSys types
- coe Glue: unfold the hcom fiber
- add explicit Path applications
  Purpose: the normalization in PApp elaboration for the endpoints could
  blow up. Explicit endpoints can be used to avoid that.
- switch to ByteString megaparsec input
