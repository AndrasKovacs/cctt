Code:
  - wrap (NeSys(HCom), IS.IVarSet) in some type


Testing:
  - hcom and coe comp rules

Feature:
- all Kan computation rules
- strict inductives
- HITs

Convenience:
- sprinkle more source positions in the parser.
- improve system compatibility error messages
  - improve system error positions
- sugar for cof disjunction and âˆ€ in systems.

- sugar for iterated projection:
  (print right-nested projection as number?
    x.1  ~ x.1
    x.2  ~ x.2.1
    x.3  ~ x.2.2.1
    x.4  ~ x.2.2.2.1
    but what about the rightmost field? Should we just use a dummy ending field?


Performance:

- unbox VSys types
- coe Glue: unfold the hcom fiber
- switch to ByteString megaparsec input
