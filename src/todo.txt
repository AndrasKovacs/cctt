- fix yaccttprelude evaluation error
- fix shadowed name printing and handling
- fix "_" name printing
- add debug pretty printing mode which is usable during evaluation
  (prints vars as indices)
- sugar for iterated projection:
  (print right-nested projection as number?
    x.1  ~ x.1
    x.2  ~ x.2.1
    x.3  ~ x.2.2.1
    x.4  ~ x.2.2.2.1
    but what about the rightmost field? Should we just use a dummy ending field?

- improve system compat error messages

- add explicit Path applications
  Purpose: the normalization in PApp elaboration for the endpoints could
  blow up. Explicit endpoints can be used to avoid that.



overload map functions in impl?

- add builtins with bidir checking: refl, _⁻¹, _◼_, ap, com, etc..

- (Switch megaparsec to strict bytestring input)

- test stuff (cubicaltt prelude, examples)

- add parametrized strict inductives (then perhaps remove Nat)
- add weak HITs
- file imports

- glued eval
  - How: add glue values
  - forcing does not remove glue
  - all semantic functions preserve glue
  - how to repr glued vals?
    - we don't use spines
    - Just another kind of neutral: Glue Ne ~Val

- hole printing
